# SDL Ping Pong
A simple ping pong game made with C++ and SDL. 

## How to Build
You're going to need CMake and the SDL2 library.
For Windows, unzip SDL into sdl-ping-pong/Extern and rename it to SDL2.
For OSX, make sure you have the SDL2 framework installed. Copy its headers to Extern/SDL2/include.

## How to Play
*W* and *S* move the left paddle.
*Up* and *Down* arrow keys move the right one.
Use *Space* or *Return* to reset the game once it's over.
